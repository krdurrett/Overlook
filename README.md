## Wins
  - Solidified my understanding of the fetch API process.
  - Practiced using Sass for styling purposes.
  - Finished basic functionality early.
  - Was able to complete the extension as well.

## Challenges + Improvements
  - Timing the display of data while waiting on an API to update is challenging. I plan on utilizing async await in future projects.
  - Would like to add ability to select a date range, using an NPM package.
  - Also would like to display user forms using a modal in the future.
